# DroNET
[**Drone device for remote identification function**](/DroNET.pdf)
DroNET is a compact add-on device, compatible with all drones on the market, specifically designed to enable drones over 250 g not equipped with a remote identification system to comply with National and European identification requirements. Through the implementation of both the Direct Remone Identification (DRI) and the Netork Remote Identification (NRI) functions, the customer will benefit from a safer and enhanced flight experience, thanks to the access to U-Space services such as surrounding traffic awareness and facilitated Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) operations.
